Requirements :
PHP 5.4+ (laravel 5.3, short array syntax 5.4)

Recommended extensions : memcached (TODO for generating trans_id)
Also see composer.json

----
PHP is nice because :
* very popular => huge community & support, lots of tutorials, extensions, open-source projects...
* it is designed for web development
* it evolves quite quickly (since 2009 : removed magic quotes, added traits, static late-binding, closures, chained calls, namespaces, yield...)
* most open-source e-commerce solutions are coded in PHP (prestashop, magento...)
* it's soooo much lighter than j2ee

PHP may be debated over :
* its syntax : $object->method( Namespace\Class::staticMethod( ['key'=>'value'] );
* its dynamic typing (although less frightening than javascript)
* its liberty : lots of frameworks, 2 debuggers, 4 ways to define a string, hundreds of way to do things (most can go wrong)

PHP is bad because :
* highly depends on local configuration (huge constraints for "universal" deployment)
* inconsistencies in basic API
* no real native UTF-8 support (yet)
